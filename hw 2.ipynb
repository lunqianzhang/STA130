    "#The Mounthall problem is a probability problem in which participants choose one of three doors, and the moderator then opens an unselected door to show a goat. Participants can choose to change the selection or keep the original selection. In theory, changing the choice increases the probability of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3. Talking to the Chatbot, you can verify this theoretical result by writing simulation code and running many rounds of tests. Chatbot can help explain the probabilistic background of the Mounthall problem. Simulation code examples are provided, and the relationship between simulation results and theoretical solutions is analyzed."
