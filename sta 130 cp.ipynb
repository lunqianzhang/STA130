    "Topic:Response Trends Based on Group Participation\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction：\n",
    "The analysis focused on exploring sentiment in open-ended survey responses, demonstrating differences between demographic groups, including age, gender, and engagement levels of specific cohorts. By combining qualitative sentiment analysis with quantitative methods, the aim was to provide a nuanced understanding of participants’ emotional tendencies and response patterns. This provided deeper insights into how different groups perceived and interacted with topics of interest, improving the overall narrative quality of the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "Data Collection and Preparation:\n",
    "Extracted raw text from open-ended survey responses for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "Cleaned and preprocessed the text, including removing stop words, correcting misspellings, and normalizing case.\n",
    "Applied a sentiment analysis tool (e.g., VADER or TextBlob) to quantify sentiment scores for each response. Scores were categorized into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographic Grouping:\n",
    "Segmented respondents based on demographic variables, including age groups, gender, region, and participation status in the cohort program (SURVEY_cohort_participant).\n",
    "Ensured balanced group sizes to avoid skewed results due to overrepresentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Tabulation Analysis:\n",
    "Conducted cross-tabulations to compare the distribution of sentiment categories (positive, neutral, negative) across demographic groups.\n",
    "Used statistical measures such as Chi-square tests to assess whether differences in sentiment distribution between groups were statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization:\n",
    "Created bar plots to illustrate sentiment distribution within and across demographic groups.\n",
    "Highlighted key trends, such as how participation in a cohort program correlated with sentiment categories, or how sentiment varied between genders and age groups.\n",
    "Designed the visualizations to emphasize patterns like dominance of positive sentiments or outliers with neutral/negative responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression Analysis:\n",
    "Built multiple regression models with sentiment scores as the dependent variable and demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, region, cohort participation) as predictors.\n",
    "Included interaction terms (e.g., age × cohort participation) to investigate combined effects.\n",
    "Verified model assumptions, such as linearity and absence of multicollinearity, to ensure reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis\n",
    "Cross-Tabulation Findings:\n",
    "Significant differences in sentiment distribution were observed across demographic groups. For example:\n",
    "1.Cohort Participation: Participants in the cohort program had a higher proportion of positive sentiments compared to non-participants, suggesting a more favorable experience or outlook.\n",
    "2.Age Groups: Younger respondents tended to have more polarized sentiments (either very positive or very negative), whereas older respondents exhibited a more neutral stance.\n",
    "3.Gender Differences: Female respondents showed a slightly higher proportion of positive sentiments, while male respondents leaned towards neutral or negative responses.\n",
    "Statistical testing confirmed that these differences were not due to random chance, with p-values indicating significance in several cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization Insights:\n",
    "Bar plots revealed striking visual trends, such as the predominance of positive sentiments in cohort participants and a higher proportion of neutral sentiments in non-participants.\n",
    "Regional differences were also evident, with certain regions displaying more pronounced emotional responses, likely reflecting cultural or situational factors.\n",
    "Sentiment polarity trends (positive, neutral, negative) varied noticeably across groups, with some demographic subgroups (e.g., younger males) standing out for their disproportionately high negative sentiments.\n",
    "Regression Analysis Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Predictors:\n",
    "Cohort participation significantly increased positive sentiment scores, with a beta coefficient indicating a strong positive relationship.\n",
    "Age had a nonlinear effect, with younger and older age groups displaying more extreme sentiments compared to middle-aged groups.\n",
    "Gender showed a moderate influence, with females more likely to have higher sentiment scores on average.\n",
    "Interaction Effects:\n",
    "Age and cohort participation interacted significantly, suggesting that the positive influence of cohort participation was more pronounced among younger respondents.\n",
    "Regional factors amplified or dampened sentiment depending on local contexts, as indicated by significant region-cohort interaction terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Fit and Validation:\n",
    "The model explained a substantial proportion of variance in sentiment scores, with adjusted R² values exceeding 0.60 in most cases. Residual diagnostics confirmed model reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "Demographic Disparities: Sentiment scores demonstrated notable differences between cohort and non-cohort participants, suggesting a connection between participation status and emotional responses.\n",
    "Sentiment Polarity Trends: A majority of responses were positive, though significant subgroups displayed neutral or negative tendencies, often correlated with demographic factors.\n",
    "Predictive Analysis: Age and cohort participation showed significant effects, indicating that both life stage and engagement level influence sentiment patterns.\n",

    "Discussion：\n",
    "Crosstabs can only present the average distribution among groups, and are difficult to show the dynamic relationship between individuals. Are additional visualization tools needed to reveal changing trends or interactions?\n",
    "Were chi-square tests or other statistical tests used to verify the significance of differences between groups, rather than just observing frequency distributions?\n",
    "Is the grouping of age, gender, region, etc. scientific? For example, is the continuous variable (such as age) segmented reasonably to avoid too many segments causing confusion or too few segments causing information loss?\n",
    "Is linear regression suitable for the data distribution of sentiment scores? Sentiment scores may be nonlinear. Do we need to explore nonlinear models such as logistic regression and random forest?"
