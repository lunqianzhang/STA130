    "Analysis 1: Response Trends Based on Group Participation\n",
    "Variables to Explore:\n",
    "1. Number of survey responses.\n",
    "2. Survey group participants.\n",
    "Analysis to Perform:\n",
    "1. Compute summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of the number of responses based on group participation.\n",
    "2. Compare response distributions using box plots.\n",
    "3. Perform independent sample t-tests to assess differences in response counts.\n",
    "First, we calculated the mean, median, and standard deviation of the number of responses to provide an overview of the central tendency and distribution of the data. Then, we used a box plot to compare the distribution of responses between the group participants and non-participants, visually displaying the differences in response rates between the two groups (such as median, distribution range, and outliers). Finally, we used an independent sample t-test to quantitatively assess whether the difference in the mean response between the two groups was statistically significant. If the p-value is less than 0.05, the difference is likely not a coincidence.\n",
    "Possible Results:\n",
    "1. The box plots may reveal different patterns of participation, with group participants having significantly higher or lower response counts compared to non-group participants.\n",
    "2. The t-test will provide a p-value indicating whether the difference in means is statistically significant.\n",
    "Relevance:\n",
    "Analyzing response trends across groups is critical to evaluating the effectiveness of the group design in capturing participant experiences. It is critical to ensure that the findings accurately reflect the behaviors and attitudes of different groups of participants.\n",
    "Analysis 2: Sociodemographic Factors Influencing Survey Responses\n",
    "Variables to Explore:\n",
    "1. Demographic variables\n",
    "2. Response variables\n",
    "Analysis to Perform:\n",
    "1. Use cross-tabulations to explore how different demographic groups answer key questions.\n",
    "2. Create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of responses by demographic group.\n",
    "3. Perform a regression analysis to quantify the effect of demographic factors on responses.\n",
    "First, we compared the distribution of questionnaire responses by demographic groups (e.g., age, gender, and region) through cross-tabulation analysis to reveal differences in response patterns between groups. Next, we visualized these distributions using bar charts to make data trends more intuitive and understandable. Finally, we quantitatively evaluated the impact of demographic factors on questionnaire responses through regression analysis, identified significant predictive variables, and quantified their impact (e.g., the increased probability of a positive response due to age).\n",
    "Possible Results:\n",
    "1. Cross-tabulation may reveal different response patterns based on demographic group.\n",
    "2. Regression analysis can highlight important predictors of survey responses, such as age or gender.\n",
    "Relevance:\n",
    "Understanding how sociodemographic factors influence survey results is critical to understanding representativeness and bias in a dataset. This information helps place the findings in the context of broader social trends in the course project.\n",
    "Analysis 3: Explore Sentiment in Open-Ended Responses.\n",
    "Variables to Explore:\n",
    "1. Open-Ended Response Variables.\n",
    "2. Survey Group Participants.\n",
    "Analysis to Perform:\n",
    "1. Use cross-tabulations to explore how different demographic groups answer key questions.\n",
    "2. Create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of responses by demographic group.\n",
    "3. Perform a regression analysis to quantify the effect of demographic factors on responses.\n",
    "First, we compared the distribution of questionnaire responses by demographic groups (e.g., age, gender, and region) through cross-tabulation analysis to reveal differences in response patterns between groups. Next, we visualized these distributions using bar charts to quickly discover trends or patterns in the data. Finally, we quantified the impact of demographic factors on questionnaire responses through regression analysis to identify significant predictors and their impact, such as how age, gender, or whether or not to participate in a group affects emotional tendencies or response patterns.\n",
    "Possible Results:\n",
    "1. You may find significant differences in sentiment scores between group and non-group participants, reflecting different attitudes or experiences.\n",
    "2. The distribution of sentiment scores can reveal whether responses are generally positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "Relevance:\n",
    "Analyzing sentiment in open-ended responses can help deepen understanding of quantitative research findings and provide a more comprehensive view of participant experience. This is important for clarifying the emotional responses of different groups of participants to the survey topic. It can help improve the narrative quality of course projects."
